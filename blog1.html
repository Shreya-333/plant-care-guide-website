      <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
      <p>Today I started learning web development.
        I’m excited to build cool stuff using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
      I'll be writting a blog on my plants using them.</p>

      <h2>🌿 My Plant Journey</h2>
      <p>I have a small garden corner that means the world to me.
        It started with a coconut plant that I planted with so much love and hope.
        I watched it grow from a tiny shoot into a little plantlet and it feels like a friend now quietly growing beside me.

      <h3>🍃 Growing Together</h3>
        <p>Over time I added a few more green friends and now this space has become something peaceful and grounding for me.</p>
         <br>
        <h3>🪴 My Peaceful Green Corner</h3>  
          <p>There’s a tulsi plant in full bloom standing proud and full of life.
             A big pot of money plants is thriving spreading its green joy around and beside them is a showcase plant with blades like tall grass and another tall plant standing upright like a guardian.</p>
          <br>
             <h3>💧 Bottles of Life</h3>
             <p>I have two glass bottles filled with water where I’ve let money plant climbers grow.
               Their roots are dense and deep floating clearly in the water like little tangled stories of growth and care
               There are three pots of aloe vera sitting calmly their thick leaves standing like quiet reminders of healing.
                I’ve also planted two flowering plants they haven’t bloomed yet but their fresh green leaves are already so beautiful and full of promise.</p>
<br>
               <h3>🪴 A Corner Close to My Heart</h3>
                 <p>This corner has become a quiet part of my life I feel deeply connected to it.
                    Every plant here is growing just like I am slowly gently and with love.</p>
<br>
                    <h3>🧘‍♀️ Where Peace Finds Me</h3>
                    <p>I am planning to add more of my babies and take good care of all of them.
                       This corner is where I feel so connected with nature and it has become a hobby that gives me peace at the end of a hard tiring day.
                       It also teaches me a lot of virtues of life like patience and care and love and the bloom that comes after all the effort and the happiness it brings.</p>
                       <br>
                       <h3>🐌 Little Setbacks Big Comebacks</h3>
                       <p>There’s so much more like when I was out of town for longer than I had planned and my plants were in a bad state.
                         The coconut leaves were covered with cocoons and one of the pots had so many baby snails but I took care of all of it.
                         I added more soil and aloe vera as a bio fertilizer to each pot and now they are so in bloom even I am shocked.</p>
                         <br>
                         <h3>🌸 Growing Together</h3>
                         <p>Taking care of these plants has become more than just a hobby for me it feels like healing and growing together.
                          I find calm in their presence and joy in their. 
                          Every new leaf feels like a small celebration and every bloom feels like a silent thank you from nature.</p>
<br>
                          <h3>🏡 From One Plant to a Home</h3>
                            <p>This little green space reminds me every day that even with small steps and simple efforts beautiful things can grow.
                                I may have started with just one coconut plant but now I have a whole corner full of life and it feels like home.</p>
